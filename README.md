# Project-STARLING
Overall project name for all work related to the automation of RC aircraft design and model creation in CAD


Project Origin:
  
   The idea of this project began back in 2014 while Niel Lewis was the head of Syracuse Universities Design Build Fly team (DBF). Due to the lack of experience underclassmen had using CAD to mock up concepts or design components, all design work fell to upper classmen. This lead to retention rates for underclassmen to be low as they lost interest.
   
   To combat this Niel originally wrote a rudimentary MATLAB script which automated portions of the design process. This script allowed users to input an airfoil name and a few rudimentary inputs such as diheydral, sweep, span, chord length, etc to generate a excel file which could be inputted into Autodesk Inventor software to create a sketch of all airfoils in a wing. 
   
  
  This code worked well enough but didn't automate the actual creation or assembly of the CAD components. 
The code also had a number of limitations when it came to loading & exporting data.
  
  
Project Goals:

    1.)   Allow users with little to no CAD experience to generate an assembled model of an RC aircraft using only numerical inputs                                                                     //        to STARLINGS interface.
     
    2.)   Allow users to export automatically generated CAD files to laser cutter format
    
    3.)   Allow design and production of a balsa wood structured RC aircraft using only user inputs. 
    
    4.)   Design STARLING to work with Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP) and FreeCAD so that it is free to use.
